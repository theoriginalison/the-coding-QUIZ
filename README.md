Homework for Week 4

- Used the Bootstrap template
- Used a Navbar with a link, and added a placeholder for where the timer will go (even if that's replaced using JS)
- Found buttons that worked the way when they were clicked & hovered over
- Found a card to contain the buttons
- Created a fixed size column so the card would float nicely in the middle of the page
- Created the CSS file & linked to the HTML
- Created the JS file & linked to the HTML (and tested this with console.log)
- Began creating variables and writing pseudocode
